## My Journey :feelsgood:

</div>

### September 2025

I'm starting with HTML. We haven't used CSS and JavaScript yet, but it's good to see all the functions step by step. I think I feel pretty confident with HTML and CSS. The one I'm most excited to learn is JavaScript because at first, the structure of that language seems very difficult to understand.

### October 2025

This month, we learned CSS and JavaScript. We made some very interesting but complex tasks, like sending data from a form to a server and more stuff. I'm starting to understand it all pretty well.

I already know what my project for this year is going to be: I'm making a videogame in JavaScript. I think it will be a great journey to make this project.
